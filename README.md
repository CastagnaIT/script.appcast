## Main features

This add-on add the support for audio/video Cast feature to Kodi with the DIAL Protocol 2.2 specifications.

Please notice that is supported Kodi 19.x or later, and for all linux devices is required Python version **3.6 or later**.

## How works

This add-on only provides the protocol support and not the individual implementations for each service (such as YouTube etc...).

Each add-on must implement his audio/video cast support individually, then you will have to create your own DIAL app ([DIAL app registry](http://www.dial-multiscreen.org/dial-registry/namespace-database)).

The instructions on how to create a new DIAL app and how to integrate it into your add-on source code in the GitHub Wiki.
